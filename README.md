# Reinforcement Learning Course 2023

As an RL enthusiast, I have always been passionate about understanding how machines can learn and make decisions in complex environments. My interest in RL led me to embark on two exciting projects that allowed me to gain hands-on experience in implementing and optimizing RL algorithms.

##First project
I implemented various basic RL algorithms such as MDP, SARSA, Q-learning, and MC. I applied these algorithms to solve maze problems and experimented with different hyperparameters to optimize their performance. This approach allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the underlying mathematics and pseudo-code of the algorithms, and to identify the most effective optimization strategies.

##Second project
I explored the use of RL to solve the classic puzzle game Sokoban. I investigated the challenges of training RL agents in a sparse reward world, where rewards are only provided at the end of the game. To address this challenge, I implemented advanced RL algorithms such as QDN, Q2DN, Q3DN, and PPO, and experimented with various techniques such as curriculum learning, intrinsic motivation, and hierarchical reinforcement learning. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the challenges of training RL agents in sparse reward scenarios and discovered effective strategies to optimize their performance.
